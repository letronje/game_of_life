Trivial implementation of Game of Life

- Universe class represents an immutable instance of a Game of life universe
  - the 'next' method inflates/deflates the next immutable universe state based on growth/death

- CellEnvironment class is used to hold info(alive, dead count) about the layer of cells(upto 8) that wraps the current cell

- New rule can be added by adding a new class to the 'Rules' module
  - For now, rules are assumed to be simple enough to consider only the cell and the number of neighbors that are alive/dead.
